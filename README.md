# README #

This is my repository for personal leetcode solutions. Most code should be written in Javascript, but other language might be used as well.

## Abbreviation Naming

When trying to use multiple solutions towards one problem, the following abbrevations might be used as postfix.

Abbreviation | Name
----|------
BS | Binary Search
BT | Backtracking
BFS | Breadth-first Search
DC | Divide and Conquer
DFS | Depth-first Search
DP | Dynamic Programming
GD | Greedy
HM | Hashmap

## Note

To view unsolved problems locally, run `sh ./list-unsolved.sh`, or install this [tampermonkey script](http://git.degree.by/degree/userscripts/raw/master/src/enhance-leetcode.user.js) if you prefer to view from website.
