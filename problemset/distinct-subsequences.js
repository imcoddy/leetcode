 * Title:   Distinct Subsequences
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
 *
 *
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 *
 *
 *
 * Here is an example:
 * S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 *
 *
 * Return 3.
