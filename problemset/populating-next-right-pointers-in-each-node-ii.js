 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
 * What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
 *
 * Note:
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 *
 *
 * For example,
 * Given the following binary tree,
 *
 *          1
 *        /  \
 *       2    3
 *      / \    \
 *     4   5    7
 *
 *
 *
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 *
 *          1 -> NULL
 *        /  \
 *       2 -> 3 -> NULL
 *      / \    \
 *     4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
 *
