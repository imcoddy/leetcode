 * Title:   Substring with Concatenation of All Words
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example, given:
 * s: "barfoothefoobarman"
 * words: ["foo", "bar"]
 *
 *
 *
 * You should return the indices: [0,9].
 * (order does not matter).
