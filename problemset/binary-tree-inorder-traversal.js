 * Title:   Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
 *
 *
 * For example:
 * Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
 *
 *    1
 *     \
 *      2
 *     /
 *    3
 *
 *
 *
 * return [1,3,2].
 *
 *
 * Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
 *
 * confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
 *
 * OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
 *
 * The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
 *
 *
 * Here's an example:
 *
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 *     /
 *    4
 *     \
 *      5
 *
 * The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
