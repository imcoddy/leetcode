 * Title:   Kth Smallest Element in a BST
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
 *
 *
 *   Try to utilize the property of a BST.
 *   What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
 *   The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
 *
