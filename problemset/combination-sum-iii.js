 * Title:   Combination Sum III
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.
 * Ensure that numbers within the set are sorted in ascending order.
 *
 *
 *
 *  Example 1:
 * Input:  k = 3,  n = 7
 * Output:
 *
 * [[1,2,4]]
 *
 *
 *  Example 2:
 * Input:  k = 3,  n = 9
 * Output:
 *
 * [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
