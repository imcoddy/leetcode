 * Title:   Word Ladder
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 *
 *
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time
 * Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
 *
 *
 *
 * For example,
 *
 *
 * Given:
 * beginWord = "hit"
 * endWord = "cog"
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 *
 *
 * As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
 * return its length 5.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
