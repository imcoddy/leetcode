 * Title:   Word Pattern
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 *  Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
 * pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
 * pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 * You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.
 *
