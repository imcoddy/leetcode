 * Title:   N-Queens
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 *
 *
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 *
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
 *
 * For example,
 * There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:
 *
 * [
 *  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
 *   "...Q",
 *   "Q...",
 *   "..Q."],
 *
 *  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 *   "Q...",
 *   "...Q",
 *   ".Q.."]
 * ]
