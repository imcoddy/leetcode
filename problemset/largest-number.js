 * Title:   Largest Number
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
 *
 * For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
 *
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
