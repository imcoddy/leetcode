 * Title:   Valid Anagram
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.
 *
 * For example,
 * s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
 * s = "rat", t = "car", return false.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
