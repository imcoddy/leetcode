 * Title:   Insert Interval
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
 *
 * You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].
 *
 *
 *
 * This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
