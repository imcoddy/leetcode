 * Title:   Validate Binary Search Tree
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 *
 *
 *
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 *
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 *
 *
 * confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
 *
 * OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
 *
 * The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
 *
 *
 * Here's an example:
 *
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 *     /
 *    4
 *     \
 *      5
 *
 * The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
