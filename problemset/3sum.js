 * Title:   3Sum
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)
 * The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *     For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},
 *
 *     A solution set is:
 *     (-1, 0, 1)
 *     (-1, -1, 2)
