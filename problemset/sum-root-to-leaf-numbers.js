 * Title:   Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.
 * An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
 *
 * Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
 *
 * For example,
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *
 *
 *
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
 * The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
 *
 *
 * Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
