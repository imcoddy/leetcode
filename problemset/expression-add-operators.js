 * Title:   Expression Add Operators
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a string that contains only digits 0-9 and a target value, return all possibilities to add binary operators (not unary) +, -, or * between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.
 *
 *
 * Examples:
 * "123", 6 -> ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"]
 * "232", 8 -> ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]
 * "105", 5 -> ["1*0+5","10-5"]
 * "00", 0 -> ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]
 * "3456237490", 9191 -> []
 *
