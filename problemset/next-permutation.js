 * Title:   Next Permutation
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
 *
 *
 * If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
 *
 *
 * The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
 *
 *
 * Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
 * 1,2,3 → 1,3,2
 * 3,2,1 → 1,2,3
 * 1,1,5 → 1,5,1
