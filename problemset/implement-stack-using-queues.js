 * Level:   Easy
 * Title:   Implement Stack using Queues
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
 *
 *
 * push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
 *
 *
 * pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
 *
 *
 * top() -- Get the top element.
 *
 *
 * empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 * Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
 * You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Update (2015-06-11):
 * The class name of the Java function had been updated to MyStack instead of Stack.
 *
