 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 *
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 *
 *
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example:
 * Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 *
 *
 * The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
