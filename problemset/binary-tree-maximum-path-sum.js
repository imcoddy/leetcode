 * Title:   Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 *
 *
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
 *
 *
 * For example:
 * Given the below binary tree,
 *
 *        1
 *       / \
 *      2   3
 *
 *
 *
 * Return 6.
