 * Title:   Symmetric Tree
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
 *
 *
 * For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   2
 *  / \ / \
 * 3  4 4  3
 *
 *
 *
 * But the following is not:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   2
 *    \   \
 *    3    3
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

 *
 * OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
 *
 * The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
 *
 *
 * Here's an example:
 *
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 *     /
 *    4
 *     \
 *      5
 *
 * The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
