 * Title:   Recover Binary Search Tree
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
 *
 * Recover the tree without changing its structure.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
 *
 *
 * confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
 *
 * OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
 *
 * The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
 *
 *
 * Here's an example:
 *
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 *     /
 *    4
 *     \
 *      5
 *
 * The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
