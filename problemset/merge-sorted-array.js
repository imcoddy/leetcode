 * Content: Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} B
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify A in-place instead.
