 * Title:   Add Digits
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
 *
 *
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *
 * Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
 *
 *
 *
 *   A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods?
 *   What are all the possible results?
 *   How do they occur, periodically or randomly?
 *   You may find this Wikipedia article useful.
 *
