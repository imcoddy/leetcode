 * Title:   Repeated DNA Sequences
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 *
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 *
 *
 * For example,
 *
 * Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",
 *
 * Return:
 * ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
