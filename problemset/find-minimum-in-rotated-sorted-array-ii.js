 * Content: Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
 * What if duplicates are allowed?
 *
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 *
 *
 * Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 *
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 *
 * Find the minimum element.
 *
 * The array may contain duplicates.
