 * Title:   Reverse Nodes in k-Group
 * Auther:  @imcoddy
 * Content: Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
 *
 *
 *
 * If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
 *
 * You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
 *
 * Only constant memory is allowed.
 *
 *
 * For example,
 * Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5
 *
 *
 *
 * For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
 *
 *
 *
 * For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
